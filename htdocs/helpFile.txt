This web page provides access to current and historic water-quality data collected at two
monitoring locations. Each of these parameters is monitored hourly at the surface (~1-meter depth)
and through the water column multiple times per day from locations near dam (at the log booms).
Data are available (per parameter) as: Profiles with a slider scale to portray conditions with
depth over time; Time-series plots, based on the hourly data collected at 1-meter depth; and
in Contours, color plots of parameter values by depth over time.
