Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have occurred in many of the large water storage
reservoirs in the Willamette River Basin, resulting in health advisories for
water contact recreation and drinking water due to the presence of cyanobacteria toxins (cyanotoxins). In 2018 for the first time in Oregon, cyanotoxins from a HAB in Detroit Lake affected the State capital of Salem's drinking water for about a month. Similar types of cyanobacterial blooms occur in Blue River and Cougar Reservoirs, in the McKenzie River Basin, with similar threats to drinking water for the City of Eugene.

To address this issue, and to complement
on-going limnological surveys, the USGS partnered with the City of Salem,
the Eugene Water and Electric Board, and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers to
monitor algal blooms in Detroit and Cougar Lakes - and the
downstream rivers - using continuous water-quality monitors that transmit
data to water treatment plant operators, dam operations, researchers and the
public in near real-time. Water quality parameters, including water temperature,
conductance, turbidity, and HAB parameters are collected vertically in the reservoirs every meter for the top 10 meters, then every 5 meters down to 30 meters depth.

HAB parameters include surrogates for algal biomass (fluorescence of total chlorophyll [fCHL] and blue-green pigment phycocyanin [fPC]), indicators of photosynthetic activity (dissolved oxygen and pH). Fluorescing dissolved organic matter [fDOM] -- a reliable surrogate for dissolved organic carbon, an important parameter for water treatment -- is also collected at each depth. These parameters are monitored hourly at the surface (~1-meter depth) and through the top portion of the water column multiple times per day from locations near the dam (at the log booms). Data are available (per parameter) as: Profiles with a slider scale to portray conditions with depth over time;
Time-series plots, based on the hourly data collected at 1-meter depth; and in Contours, color plots of parameter values by depth over time. When taken together with the downstream continuous water-quality monitors these data provide an early-warning indicator of an algal bloom in the reservoir, or the possible release and transport of algae downstream to drinking-water intakes. These data also provide insights into the evolution, behavior, and decay of the seasonal blooms which can inform management strategies, modeling, and perhaps prediction of blooms in the future.
